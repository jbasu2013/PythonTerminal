I wrote this serial data program in Python 3.5 so that I could compare it to the one I wrote in C#.

I wrote TERMINAL.PY and SERIAL_RX_TX.PY on Windows 10 using the Pycharm IDE.

These two modules show you how to use serial COM ports on Windows 10 to do the following:

- send and receive lines of text terminated with \n
- handle received data with your own event-handler
- send lines of text at regular intervals from a file (replay a log file)

Additional changes needed for simplified usage
Modify : 1) Add receive functions to serial_rx_tx.py class
         2) create a new file terminal1.py remove reference to tk, and make it fully command based
